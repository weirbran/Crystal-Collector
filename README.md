# Crystal Collector

### Overview

This is the fourth assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivered at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment, we were required to create a fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library. When a user clicks on a crystal, their score is dynamically with jQuery. When they win or lose, jQuery is used again to update the display on the HTML page. Javascript functions are used to compare the user's score to the app's randomly selected number and to keep track of win/losses.

The user is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals on the page and clicking on a crystal will add a specific amount of points to the user's total score. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. The user wins when their total score is equal to the random number. The user loses if their total score is higher than the random number. The game restarts after every win or loss.
